Tools I have found so far which appear to be useful:

gdown - see https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown

this is simple and fantastic command line tool

pip3 install gdown

typical usage:

gdown --fuzzy https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PvDiL1QjdjDqXvTG33E7KkHiw2it8aM2/view?usp=share_link -O myfilename_whatever_I_want.pdf

Google drive api documentation is...not terribly intuitive.

https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/revisions/list

calling this with a fileId set to an appropriate value will actually list the "last modified" date...however this appears to only work on files in currently authenticated user's drive, not other files publicly shared
