Grab track and manage only the latest updates in a publicly shared google drive folder

Problem as described:

Karaoke DJ has access to a publicly accessible Google shared drive folder containing karaoke files generated by community.  Right now they have to manually track and schedule downloads, rename files according to the way they organize things, etc.  DJ wishes to automate as much of this process as possible.  I believe they wish to mirror every file on the shared drive.  Right now they have to manually identify what the latest files are that have been added and schedule them for download.

Some of the issues:

DJ is on a Windows machine so solution should be portable to Windows environment.  It would also be good if the solution were simple enough not to involve a lot of additional softawre to update and maintain.

File structure on shared drive is irregular and eclectic.  Different contributors have the actual files at different depths within different subfolder structures.  Script should also be flexible enough to anticipate future changes, different contributors, restructures, etc.

UPDATE

Google Drive API is a radioactive disaster for the use case we are trying to solve.

Stupid hacky solution works and may be generally applicable to similar use cases for data gathering...
